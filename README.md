A Deep Learning based Fashion Recommender System using the ResNET50
A fashion recommender system using deep learning and ResNet50 leverages computer vision to suggest fashion items based on user preferences or images. ResNet50, a powerful convolutional neural network (CNN), is commonly used due to its ability to capture complex visual patterns. Hereâ€™s how it typically works:

1. Feature Extraction: ResNet50 is pre-trained on a large dataset like ImageNet to recognize visual features. In this context, it can be fine-tuned on a fashion dataset to extract features from images of clothing, accessories, or footwear.


2. Embedding Generation: For each item, ResNet50 generates a high-dimensional feature embedding that represents its visual attributes (like style, color, and texture). This is stored in a feature database.


3. Similarity Matching: When a user provides an image or selects a style, the system uses ResNet50 to generate the embedding of the input and then compares it with the stored embeddings in the database using similarity metrics (e.g., cosine similarity).


4. Recommendation: Based on the similarity scores, the system recommends items with similar features, helping users find visually similar or complementary products.



This system can be expanded with additional layers like LSTM for sequential user behavior or GANs for generating style variations, improving personalization in fashion recommendations.
